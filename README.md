## Overview of the Analysis
In this project we are analyzing NYC Citi Bike data in order to understand the business model and start a bike rental in the city of Des Moines Iowa. We are approaching the data by analyzing how bike rental is different by the day of the week and hours; Also, how different bike rental is per gender. Moreover, we are looking on how long are rental trips. Here we have the full analysis: [link to dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/profile/andres3195#!/vizhome/Citi_Bike_Challenge_16042688657040/NYCCitibikeAnalysis?publish=yes)
